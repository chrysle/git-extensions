[alias]
	; Alternative: Do this programmatically:
	; 	git config --global alias.foo 'commit -m "foobar"'

	; Note: You cannot override a built-in Git command via an alias. Cp.
	; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538774/is-it-possible-to-override-git-command-by-git-alias
	;
	;alias = config --global --get-regexp 'alias\\..*' ; List all defined aliases.
	; Note: If you name the shell command "git-aliasname", there's no need
	; to define an alias here; Git will automatically pick it up. The
	; downside is that you cannot pass alias arguments to it here:
	; "!git-aliasname arg1" will NOT pass arg1 to the script!
	; (But "git aliasname arg1" on the command-line will work.)
	;alias = !git-alias
	; Note: You also cannot use a shell command "git-builtin" to override
	; the "git builtin" command! To achieve that, you need a custom "git"
	; shell function that intercepts the git call.
	; To do something with individual arguments, use something like this:
	;x = "!sh -c 'echo args: \"$@\"' -"
	; But I prefer defining an external git-subcommand for this.
